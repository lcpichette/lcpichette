### Your greatest summits pale in scale of your discipline, consistency, and patience.

----

The above is a statement I live by. This foundation, seen as concisely as I've been able to make it in the above, I built myself largely influenced by the following quotes:

> "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit."
> — Will Durant (paraphrasing Aristotle)

> "The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones."
> — Confucius

> "Act without expectation."
> — Lao Tzu

> "Become who you are."
> — Friedrich Nietzsche

Ultimatey we need discipline to start, the consistency to take each step required to get to our goal, and the patience to complete the long journey. I sincerely believe that this journey isn't worthwhile if there are ulterior motives associated to it -- it simply must be, because it is what you are. I believe it is this deeper alignment of self to growth which is the glue that keeps these pieces together.

Lastly, I want to elaborate on my definition of Discipline. As it's a bit different from most. I don't believe it's enduring pain and doing it regardless. I believe it is a cognitive muscle that relies on flexibility and rationality. Let's walk through my normal morning for example. I wake up and think to myself "this bed is so cozy, I can afford to sleep in longer. I didn't get my 8 hours last night, and it'd only be healthy to get 8 hours right?" Well, there's some who think that Discipline here would be "Nah, get up and get to work" without any further thinking. But that'll lead you to crashing out. Instead, consider why you're wanting more sleep. Did I get 7.5 hours and I'm using those 30m as an excuse to not exert energy? Or, did I only get 5 hours, and there's a valid reason to sleep more -- even if it means you get less done today. If the former, then you start to consider the benefits. Well, if I start my day now instead of sleeping, I can make myself a cup of coffee, plan out my day, and I *know* I'll feel happier than I would if I slept in instead. Suddenly, the decision becomes much easier. The last step is to believe in your judgement and take action. This process to me is what Discipline is.
