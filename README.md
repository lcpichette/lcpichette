### Your greatest summits pale in scale of your discipline, consistency, and patience.

----

The above is a statement I live by. This foundation, seen as concisely as I've been able to make it in the above, I built myself largely influenced by the following quotes:

> "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit."
> — Will Durant (paraphrasing Aristotle)

> "The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones."
> — Confucius

> "Act without expectation."
> — Lao Tzu

> "Become who you are."
> — Friedrich Nietzsche

Ultimatey we need discipline to start, the consistency to take each step required to get to our goal, and the patience to complete the long journey. I sincerely believe that this journey isn't worthwhile if there are ulterior motives associated to it -- it simply must be, because it is what you are. I believe it is this deeper alignment of self to growth which is the glue that keeps these pieces together.
